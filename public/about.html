<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Experience designer, Google UX/UI certified with over 10 years of creative experience. I specialize in
  using research to identify faults or areas of improvement, implementing data to create or enhance brand identity,
  then using Figma and Adobe Creative Suite to craft impactful digital solutions

<p>When I'm not designing, I'm writing, reading manga, watching anime or listening to music.</p>

<p>I'm married with 2 perfect, troublesome kids.</p>
