<h1>The Best Movies, According to Pallo</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Training Day</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love how the main character was dark and evil and it didn't have a happy ending.</p>
<h3>The Book of Eli</h3>
<p>Love the dystopian feel and the surprise ending.</p>
<h3>Devilman Crybaby</h3>
<p>Another Dark anime with interesting characters and a dark ending</p>
